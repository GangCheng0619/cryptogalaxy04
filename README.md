I am a Full-Stack developer with years of experience in enterprise and high-performance responsive web technologies for both frontend and backend. Also, I am a self taught Full-Stack Developer, passionate about learning new technologies. I have a working proficiency in JavaScript, React, Redux, HTML, CSS, Node, Express, PGSQL, MongoDB and Sass. I am skilled at making single page applications and progressive web apps with the extended ecosystems that allow your software to operate on multiple devices. I utilize ReactJS, VueJS, AngularJS, HTML5, JavaScript, and other flexible and powerful techniques to create reliable, fast and engaging web apps. I am also skilled at making cost effective cross-platform mobile app development using React Native. I am looking to further expand my skill set by gaining more in depth back-end knowledge. I adapt easily to new challenges and seek solutions to problems that arise sporadically.
